# Predicting Success of Kickstarter Project
Kickstarter is a crowdfunding website used for non-traditional investment. If the goal is not met by the deadline, no funds are collected. The project must create something to share with others,no equity investment. On average, projects get 30 days to raise their minimum funding goal.
